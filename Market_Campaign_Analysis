- `job`: Occupation of the customer (e.g., student, management, technician)
- `education`: Education level (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- `marital`: Marital status
- `contact`: Contact method used (cellular, telephone, unknown)
- `duration`: Call duration in seconds
- `DurationBucket`: Call duration categorized into short, medium, long
